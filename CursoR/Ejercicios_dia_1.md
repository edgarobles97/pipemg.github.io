1. Calculate square root of 729        (sqrt)
2. Create a new variable 'b' with value 1947.0        
3. Convert 'b' from previous exercise to character (as.character)
4. Setup your working directory to a new 'work' folder in your desktop (setwd/getwd)
5. Create a vector numbers from 1 to 6 and find out its class (c / class)
6.  Initialise a character vector of length 26
7. Assign the character 'a' to the first element in above vector.
8. Create a vector with some of your friend's names (c)
9. Get the length of above vector  (length)
10. Get the first two friends from above vector 
11. Get the 2nd and 3rd friends 
12. Sort your friends by names using 2 methods (sort/order)
13. Reverse direction of the above sort (rev)
14. Create customised vector sequences (Rep/seq)
15. Remove missing value from c(1, 2, NA, 4)   *is.na
16. Pick 50 random numbers between 1 to 100, with replacement
17. Check the class of last variable
18.  Find the class of ‘iris’ dataframe, find the class of all the columns of ‘iris’, get the summary of ‘iris’, get the top 6 rows, view it in a spreadsheet format, get row names, get column names, get number of rows and get number of columns.

20.  Get rows with Sepal.Width > 3.5 using which() from iris
21. Get the rows with 'versicolor' species using subset() from iris
22. Create this character vector using paste: 'var1', 'var2', 'var3', 'pred1', 'pred2', 'pred3'
23. Tabulate the Sepal.Width for each Species from iris
